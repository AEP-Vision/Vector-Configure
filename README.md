### Onboard

Install Python and run ``pip install anki_vector``.

Locate the "configure" folder and replace it with the 2.0 folder ([download replacement here](https://github.com/AEP-Vision/Vector-Configure/releases)).

Onboard using your Stratus account using ``python3 -m pip install --user anki_vector``

### Notes

SDK will *only* work as tested on Python 2.9

Animation handling *will* fail. Avoid this as much as possible, I’m working to fix it.
